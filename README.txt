The Problem:

When playing Scotland Yard, I build a tree of the possible paths that Mr X may
have taken, using the available information. For example, if Mr X surfaces on
space 108, takes a taxi, and then a bus, where could he end up?

This program is an experiment in Scala that uses solving this problem as its
focus; as such, I do a little experimentation with more generically useful
solutions, instead of a targeted solution to this individual problem.
